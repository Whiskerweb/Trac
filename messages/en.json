            "title": "Frequently asked questions",
            "q1": { "q": "How does the referral program work?", "a": "Every Traaaction seller has a unique referral link. When a new seller signs up via your link and starts generating sales, you automatically receive a percentage of the revenue (excl. tax) on every transaction — for life." },
            "q2": { "q": "Where does the referral commission money come from?", "a": "Referral commissions are funded by Traaaction, from our 15% platform fee. The referred seller earns exactly the same as a non-referred seller. Nothing changes for them, nor for the startup." },
            "q3": { "q": "How many generations can I earn from?", "a": "Up to 3 generations. You earn 5% on your direct referrals' sales, 3% on their referrals' sales, and 2% on the 3rd generation. Maximum 10% of revenue per sale." },
            "q4": { "q": "When do I receive my earnings?", "a": "Referral commissions follow the same cycle as regular commissions: a 30-day hold period (chargeback protection), then they become available for withdrawal via Stripe Connect, PayPal, or bank transfer." },
            "q5": { "q": "Does the referral expire?", "a": "No, the referral is for life. As long as your referral generates sales on Traaaction, you earn your referral commission. No time limit." },
            "q6": { "q": "Do I need to be an active seller to refer?", "a": "Yes, you need to have completed your seller profile on Traaaction. Your referral link is generated automatically and accessible from your dashboard, in the Referral section." },
            "q7": { "q": "What happens if a sale is refunded?", "a": "If a sale is refunded, all related commissions (seller commission + referral commissions) are automatically cancelled. If they have already been paid out, a negative balance is applied." }
